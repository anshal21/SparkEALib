Project: Solving Problems with Genetic Algorithms using Spark.

Proposal : Designing and implementing a generalized framework with implementation of all kind of mutation and cross-over operation that are specific to all problems whose solution can be represented as -
A Vector of Doubles or Integers (Eg. finding waits of hidden units in Artificial Neural Network, Coefficient of terms in some equation )
A Permutation of Integers (Eg. Travelling Salesman problem. N-Queen Problem)

We will be designing a generalized framework that can use for any problem that can be represented in above formats. We will be running our algorithm parallel on different machines with different values of control parameters and finally select the most optimal solution of all.

As genetic algorithms involves randomness, so each algorithm run involves a probability of not reaching to an optimal solution. But if we are doing multiple runs with different control parameters then the probability of not reaching to a suboptimal solution by all the machine will be very less as compared to previous.
